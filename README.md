# owstats-OCRwatch
Using [Haylee Schäfer InventivetalentDev](https://github.com/InventivetalentDev) [OCRwatch](https://github.com/InventivetalentDev/OCRwatch) to track and send data to owstats

## Summary
This is repo to hold some modifications done to OCRWatch in order to send the data tracked to the API of owstats, i'll keep this updated with the original repo 

## How it works
Pretty much the same as the original repo just that when it generates the json it also sends the data to the owstats api if the authorization token and endpoint are setup correctly 

## How to use it
Ideally you dont have to bother with much i'll keep an archive linked to this repo that contains the exe and a config file, you just need to update the config file with the token from the API and voila
I will add more details on how to use this locally later...

## Current work item
* Detect end of game 
* Detect win/lose/draw

## Roadmap
* Keep up to date with the original repo
* Detect more stats
